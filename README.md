# Bambulab Esp32 LEDController #


## Getting started - [also check the Wiki!](https://github.com/vr6syncro/Bambulab_Esp32_LEDController/wiki)


[Click here to get to the flasher.](https://vr6syncro.de/programmer/esp32.html "Click here to get to the flasher.")

The ESP32 is flashed with the firmware.

The ESP32 is now building a W-Lan access point with which we connect. The current password is: `password`

After that we have to navigate to the Wifimanager Config page with a browser.
The IP is: `192.168.4.1`

There you enter your W-Lan registration data.

Optionally, the Bambulab printer can be set up now or you can set it up later via the serial console or via the website.

If the EPS32 is connected to the WiFi, you should be able to find and reach it in your network.
The IP of the device is also output via the console if a programming app is installed.

As soon as you enter the IP of the EPS32 in your browser, you will get to the welcome page.
On the right side of the navigation you get to the configuration.

If the printer is not already connected, it reboots once after saving the data and it should connect to the MQTT.
